A. Transmitter Specifications

   Your three mystery signals are generated with the M6 transmitter
   standard in m6params.m, described in SRD, Chap 15, with these
   frame parameters:

     userDataLength:   125
     preamble:         '0x0 This is is the Frame Header 1y1'

   and with the following RF parameters:

   mysteryA:  SRRCLength:     7
              SRRCrolloff:    0.24
              T_t:            8.9e-6 s
              f_if:           1.6 MHz
              f_s:            700 kHz 

   mysteryB:  SRRCLength:     4
              SRRCrolloff:    0.26
              T_t:            7.5e-6 s
              f_if:           1.2 MHz
              f_s:            950 kHz

   mysteryC:  SRRCLength:     6
              SRRCrolloff:    0.32
              T_t:            8.14e-6 s
              f_if:           2.2 MHz
              f_s:            819 kHz


B. Deliverables due January 22, 2024

  1. Executable receiver code (.m files of one receiver for all
     mystery signals) and your recovered mysteries.

  2. Project report (pdf)

    a. Describe your SRD implementation concisely.

    b. Give technical reasons for each design choice in your radio.

    c. If you work with a project partner, identify the contributions
       of each partner.


C. Plagiarism

  1. Do not plagiarize.  Protect yourself and your fellow students
     from plagiarizing by not releasing your own project work.

  2. Plagiarism will be reported as attempt of deception for each of
     the involved students.
